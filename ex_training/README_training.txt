This code is a EXAMPLE of training.  
I want to upload samples of training features but I can not upload them because of GitHub’s limitation.(The size of training data is too big…)  

If you are a member of MAC lab, you can get the training features from Bach server: /media/disk1/tutorialDNN.

I use RWC data NO.1~29 songs in this code and compute spectrogram with…

Resampleing : 8kHz MONO channel.
STFT : Hann window = 1024 samples, Hop size = 80, FFT size = 1024
 
If you know more detail,
